## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### ✅ Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded CSV data using Pandas
- Inspected structure using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`

### ✅ DateTime Processing
- Converted Date column to `datetime` format for time-based analysis

### ✅ Monthly Expense Analysis
- Calculated total expenses per month

### ✅ Category-wise Expense Analysis
- Grouped expenses by category
- Identified highest spending category

### ✅ Advanced Filtering
- Filtered expenses greater than a specific amount

### ✅ Visualization
- Bar chart for category-wise expenses using Matplotlib
