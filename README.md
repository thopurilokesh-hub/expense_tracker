# 💰 Expense Tracker Analysis using Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes personal expense data using **Python and Pandas** to gain insights into spending patterns.  
It focuses on **monthly trends**, **category-wise expenses**, and identifying **high-expense areas**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze monthly spending trends
- Identify highest spending categories
- Calculate average expenses per category
- Filter and analyze large expenses
- Practice real-world data analysis using Pandas

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- CSV file handling

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset (`expenses.csv`) contains the following columns:

| Column Name   | Description |
|--------------|------------|
| Date         | Date of expense |
| Category     | Expense category (Food, Transport, etc.) |
| Amount       | Expense amount |
| Description  | Short description of expense |

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### ✅ Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded CSV data using Pandas
- Inspected structure using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`

### ✅ DateTime Processing
- Converted Date column to `datetime` format for time-based analysis

### ✅ Monthly Expense Analysis
- Calculated total expenses per month

### ✅ Category-wise Expense Analysis
- Grouped expenses by category
- Identified highest spending category

### ✅ Advanced Filtering
- Filtered expenses greater than a specific amount

### ✅ Visualization
- Bar chart for category-wise expenses using Matplotlib
